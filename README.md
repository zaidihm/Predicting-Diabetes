# Predicting-Diabetes

🏥 Predicting Diabetes using Machine Learning

📌 Project Overview
This project predicts the likelihood of diabetes in patients using machine learning models. We analyze a dataset of patient health metrics, perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and train multiple classifiers to make predictions.

🔥 Features
EDA on patient health data
Correlation analysis between features
Training models:
✔ Decision Tree
✔ Gradient Boosting
✔ Logistic Regression
Model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrices

📊 Dataset Information
The dataset contains patient health records, including:
Glucose level
Blood pressure
BMI
Age
Pregnancy count
Diabetes pedigree function
The target variable is whether a patient has diabetes (1) or not (0).

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
Seaborn & Matplotlib (for EDA)
Scikit-learn (for ML models)

📊 Model Performance
Accuracy comparison of different models
Confusion matrices for error analysis
Cross-validation for better model reliability

🔮 Future Enhancements
Implement deep learning models for improved accuracy
Use feature engineering to enhance model performance
Explore other ML algorithms like Random Forest and SVM
